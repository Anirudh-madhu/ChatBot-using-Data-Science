# ChatBot-using-Data-Science
In this project my objective was to build a chatbot using deep learning. The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories like intents, pattern, and response. I have used recurrent neural network to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and provide a random response from the list of responses.
